                <p> This is the first paragraph for the second assignment. I dont really
                    know what to put in here. I'm really just trying to test whether
                    or not I can implement a responsive design. You know all of the
                    stuff I'm learning in this class is really cool. All of the coursera
                    classes seem to be more applicable and better at teaching than my
                    physical in real life classes at college. It kinda makes you wonder
                    the point of it all huh?
